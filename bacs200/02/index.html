            What makes a hero?  A hero is someone that we look up to.
            Heroes embody what we truly value most.  Therefore who we select as
            role models says a lot about who we are as people.

            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Courageous - they are not afraid to try something new</li>
            <li>Motivate others - They push you to try your hardest, and give advice when needed</li>
            <li>Sacrifice & commitment - they put everything they have into what they are doing, and stay committed</li>
            <li>Integrity - they live true to themselves </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I dont think to be a hero you have to impact millions of people, but its how you impact the people who are around you. When looking at the list of what makes a hero, the first two people that come to mind are the best tag-team duo my world has ever seen. My parents Samuel & Jodi Adams, they check every box on what I think a hero is and more. They motivate anyone in their life to succeed no matter the subject. My dad taught me to be resourceful,loyal, brave, and fearless, sometimes maybe a little too fearless. He showed me what it takes to be a man, a father, and a husband. Every role he weither it be as a father, husband, or employe, he does to the best of his capeablitites. My mom has taught me to be kind to everyone, to be cautious of myself and my surroundings, and to bring joy and happiness into everything I do. She can lighten up any darkness thrown in her direction. She is the strongest person I know with more courage than anyone. If who I choose as a hero represents who I am as a person, there is nobody better than the people who molded me as a person.
